## Team Chat

This is based off of a Youtube Tutorial created by Code With Antonio. I am going to use the tutorial to get a base application done, and then start changing things to meet the needs of the applications intended use case.

Made with bun, nextjs, and convex. Convex will be used for development and when I first start testing. After everything is ready, if this gets used, I will modify the code to allow the use of a self-hosted MySQL database.

Also once the web application is complete I will use Electron to create a desktop application for windows and linux.
